I'm currently a first-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering, [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). Iâ€™m fortunate and honored to be advised by [Prof. Wei Wang](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/) and supported by [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funding_opport/hkpfs/call_letter.html). Before joining HKUST, I got my B.S. degree in Electronic Science and Technology from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in 2023.

**Research interest:** LLM security and privacy.
