I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I joined the RenAI Lab in 2024, where I have the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Yiren Fung](https://yrf1.github.io/) and am supported by the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funding_opport/hkpfs/call_letter.html). Prior to HKUST, I received my B.S. degree in Electronic Science and Technology from [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in 2023.

My Research interests lie generally in the area of Natural Language Processing, with focus on **Trustworthy LLMs**. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration or would like to have a casual discussion.
