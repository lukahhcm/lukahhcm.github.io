I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering, [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I’m fortunate and honored to be advised by [Prof. Wei Wang](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/) and supported by [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funding_opport/hkpfs/call_letter.html). Before joining HKUST, I got my B.S. degree in Electronic Science and Technology from [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in 2023.

My Research interests lie generally in the area of machine learning, with focus on **LLM security and privacy**. Feel free to contact me for  collaborations or a casual talk.
