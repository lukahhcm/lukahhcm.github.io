Hi! I'm **Yuchen Huang (黄宇晨)**, a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I am fortunate to be supported by the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funding_opport/hkpfs/call_letter.html) and supervised by [Prof. Yiren Fung](https://mayrfung.github.io/). Since September 2025, I have also been a research intern at [Tongyi Lab, Alibaba](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/), collaborating with [Daoyuan Chen](https://yxdyc.github.io/). Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.S. degree in Electronic Science and Technology from [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in 2023.

My research interests generally lie in the area of **AI/NLP**, focusing on building more **human-centric, trustworthy, and powerful LLMs/VLMs/Agents**. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration or would like to have a casual discussion.
